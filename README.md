# Make it Smart
>- An interactive City Management game developed using Unity (2D) which instills various ***Smart-City terminologies*** and ***methodologies*** in the player and assesses the player based on the ***Upgrades*** made to the city within the given ***Time***, with the given ***Resources***.
>- Overall it's a fun way to generate awareness about Smart cities and how they are different from Normal cities.
